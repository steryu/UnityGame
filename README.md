# An Untitled Unty game

A month ago I started making a roquelike game in Unity using C#. I always wanted to start a hobby project like this and since I have two year coding experience, I decided to make my first project a bigger one. Learning C# was also not difficult at all because my first language was C.

This project is still a work in progress. It's public only so I can show it in my portfolio
